        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to ShadowART ("we," "our," or "us"). ShadowART is a mood journaling and psychological self-reflection application designed for iOS. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your most personal thoughts remain yours alone.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>All journaling content and psychological analysis are processed entirely on your device.</strong> No journal text, emotional analysis, shadow archetype detection, or keyword extraction is ever transmitted to external servers.</li>

        </div>

        <p><strong>Anonymous Usage Analytics</strong></p>

        <p>ShadowART uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregate usage data — <strong>but only if you explicitly opt in</strong> through the App's Settings screen. Analytics are <strong>disabled by default</strong>.</p>

        <p>If you choose to opt in, the following anonymous events may be recorded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App open events</li>
            <li>Feature usage events (e.g., visual entry saved, journal submitted, analysis completed)</li>
            <li>Session duration (in seconds, without content)</li>
            <li>Subscription-related events (paywall viewed, subscription started)</li>
            <li>Settings interactions (data exported, data reset)</li>
            <li>Onboarding flow completion</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What is never collected, even with analytics enabled:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Journal text or reflection content</li>
            <li>Keywords, trigger phrases, or archetype results</li>
            <li>Any personally identifiable information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers linked to personal identity</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Browsing history or cross-app tracking data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any account credentials</li>

            <li>Microphone input or voice recordings</li>
            <li>Location or GPS data</li>

            <li>Browsing history</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <h3>4.1 On-Device Processing</h3>
        <p>All core functionality is performed locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Sentiment analysis, emotion detection, shadow archetype identification, keyword extraction, and semantic similarity scoring are all performed using Apple's on-device NaturalLanguage framework. No text content leaves your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Detection:</strong> Automatic detection of your writing language (e.g., English, Turkish, Spanish) is performed on-device using Apple's NLLanguageRecognizer.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Playback:</strong> Ambient soundscapes and text-to-speech affirmations are synthesized and played locally. No audio is recorded or transmitted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Analytics Data (If Opted In)</h3>
        <p>If you choose to enable analytics, anonymous usage data is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand which features are most valuable to users</li>
            <li>Identify and fix technical issues</li>
            <li>Improve the overall user experience</li>
            <li>Inform future feature development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analytics data is processed by Firebase (Google LLC) under their data processing terms. No personal content or identifying information is included in analytics events.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Subscription Management</h3>
        <p>Subscription purchases and billing are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store and StoreKit. We do not process, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID credentials. The yearly subscription plan includes a 7-day free trial. Free trial eligibility and billing are managed entirely by Apple.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>All personal data (journal entries, mood selections, shadow insights, keywords, and progress metrics) is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework with the following protections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device-Level Encryption:</strong> Local data is protected with <code>NSPersistentStoreFileProtectionKey</code> set to <code>.complete</code>, meaning your data is encrypted whenever your device is locked.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Database:</strong> There is no external server or cloud database storing your content by default.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 iCloud Sync (Pro Feature, Optional)</h3>
        <p>Pro subscribers may enable iCloud synchronization to keep their data in sync across multiple Apple devices. When enabled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is transmitted and stored using Apple's CloudKit infrastructure</li>
            <li>All data in transit and at rest is encrypted by Apple</li>
            <li>Synchronization is governed by Apple's iCloud Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</li>
            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time through the App's settings</li>
            <li>Disabling sync does not delete data already synced; you must manage iCloud storage through your device's Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 File Sharing & Data Export</h3>
        <p>ShadowART allows you to export your data via the iOS Files app. This feature is provided for your convenience and for compliance with data portability rights. Exported files are stored in your device's local file system or iCloud Drive under your control.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>6. Biometric Authentication</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Biometric data is processed entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework</li>
            <li>We do not access, store, or transmit biometric data</li>
            <li>Biometric templates never leave Apple's Secure Enclave on your device</li>
            <li>You can enable or disable biometric lock at any time through Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>7. Notifications</h2>

            <li>Are not push notifications from a remote server</li>
            <li>Do not contain personal data or journal content</li>
