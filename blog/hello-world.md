# Hello World

Welcome to the new umay.dev. I rebuilt this site from scratch — clean, minimal, and focused on what matters: the work itself.

## Why the redesign?

The old site served me well, but it was time for something that better reflects where I'm at now. Less noise, more signal.

## What's next?

I'll be sharing thoughts on development, side projects, and whatever else catches my attention. Stay tuned.
